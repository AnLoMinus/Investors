# SparkInvest Grid Vision

SparkInvest Grid (SI) centralizes every investor, sponsor, and donor who backs the SparKing universe. Each person or organization gets a transparent card, showing contributions, focus areas, and how their support fuels the creative studio.

## Core principles
- **אמון**: show clear contribution history for every investor.
- **שקיפות**: keep frontmatter metadata synchronized with structured data files.
- **הכרת הטוב**: highlight the story behind each contribution, not just the numbers.
- **שותפות**: emphasize collaborations across projects like Nesle SparKing, HacKing-DJ, and SparkCards.

## Why it matters
A lightweight Markdown-first repository makes onboarding simple, keeps history in Git, and is ready for future automation via the JSON/CSV data under `data/`.
